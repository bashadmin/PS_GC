# //Here are few hints to fix this issue:

# Download the file only once from the URL.

# Pre-process it so that the same calculation doesn't need to be done over and over again. This can be done in two ways. You can choose any one of them:

# To create a dictionary with the start dates and then use the data in the dictionary instead of the complicated calculation.
# To sort the data by start_date and then go date by date.
# Choose any one of the above preprocessing options and modify the script accordingly.

# Once youâ€™ve completed modifying the Python script, save the file by clicking Ctrl-o, the Enter key, and Ctrl-x.
