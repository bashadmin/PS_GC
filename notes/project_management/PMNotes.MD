Project management job categories and common roles 
Introductory-level project management roles
Entry-level project management positions are a great opportunity to get your foot in the door and learn the ins and outs of how a company operates and manages projects. The lessons you learn from these experiences are extremely valuable to your growth in project management. Some entry-level project management positions include:

Junior Project Manager: Performs all aspects of being a project manager alongside a more experienced professional.
Project Administrator: Assists the rest of the project team with administrative tasks. 
Project/Program Assistant: Supports team members working on a project and offers administrative support. May perform research or create training documents along with other jobs as assigned by program leaders.
Project/Program Coordinator: Participates in hands-on project work and administrative tasks. Works under a project manager to make sure projects are completed on time and within budget.
Project Support Specialist: Works alongside a project manager and team members to oversee assigned projects. May also be responsible for training and developing employees to perform designated tasks.
Traditional project management roles
Once you have gained some experience in introductory-level positions, you can explore traditional project management roles, such as:

Project Manager: Responsible for the initiating, planning, monitoring, and closing of a project. Includes industry-specific titles like IT project manager, construction project manager, or engineering project manager, which utilize skills that are transferable among industries.
Project Analyst: Moves a project along by sharing information, providing support through data analysis, and contributing to strategy and performance. 
Project Leader/Director: Drives core decision-making and sets the direction for the project. Usually knowledgeable about the product or deliverable. 
Project Controller: Primarily responsible for project planning. You are likely to see this job title in industries like engineering and construction.
Technical Project Manager: Conducts project planning and management for identified goals within a company. Ensures that projects are completed to the requirements within a defined time frame and budget.
Project Management Office (PMO) Analyst: Manages the process of complex projects to ensure timely execution and completion. 
Program management roles
After you have carried out projects successfully and feel you are ready for a step up in responsibility, a program manager position may be the next step for you. Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. These managers are responsible for several or entire portfolios of projects for one client. Program management positions include:

Program Manager: Program managers are essentially project managers but on a larger scale. They manage a group of projects that are similar or related to one another and handle coordination across multiple projects that are used to meet a program’s main goals. They also create and manage long-term goals for an organization.
Portfolio Manager: Responsible for managing a group of different programs or projects within the same organization. These projects or programs may be related to one another. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs, and prioritize work as necessary. 
Operational management roles 
In operational management roles, you will get the opportunity to experience several different departments and how they interact and operate. Operational management roles allow you to work alongside peers and management from various business segments, giving you an appreciation for what each segment does on a daily basis. Key elements of project management include making sure a project is on budget and on schedule. This course, and your experience as a project manager, will give you the tools to be able to apply those skills to running a business. Some operational management positions include:

Operations Analyst: Manages and coordinates research, investigates workflows, creates business procedures, and recommends changes to improve the project and company. 
Operations Manager: Oversees strategic decision-making and rolls out plans of action based on financial, schedule, and resource reporting. 
Chief Operating Officer: Responsible for overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business.
Agile roles
We will discuss the Agile project management approach in depth later, but here are a couple of the positions you may see that are related to that approach:

Scrum Master: Coordinates and guides the Scrum team. Knowledgeable in Agile framework and Scrum and is able to teach others about the Scrum values and principles 
Product Owner: Drives the direction of product development and progress. 
Industry-specific management roles
As you search for project management roles, you may see positions with titles like “engineering project manager” or “construction project manager.” Keep in mind that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. For example, you may have experience as a software engineer but are interested in pursuing a career in project management. You will be able to apply what you’ve learned working in a technical field, as well as with the skills you have picked up in this certification course, to a project manager position in multiple industries. Having experience working on a team to achieve a task and understanding how to execute an effort on schedule and on budget are aspects of your professional experience—combined with your project management knowledge—that make it possible for you to move between industries.
