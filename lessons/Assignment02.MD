### 1: String output
Write a program that displays the word into to the screen.

### 2: string, int and float variable assignment
Write a program that assigns values for an odd number from 1 to 99, a floating point number from 1 to 100, and a fruit, and display them to the user.

### 3: Basic user input of strings
Write a program that asks the user to enter a flower and then displays it on the screen. 

### 4: Echoing input

### 5: String output with whitespace

### 6: String output with special characters
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sport, a body part, and a word, echo each to the screen, and then print out each item, all on one line, separated by "$"

### 7: Getting integer and float input from the user
Write a program that asks the user to enter a name, an even number from 2 to 100, and a floating point number from 1 to 100, echo each to the screen, and then print out each item, separated by a ")".
NOTE! Just print using the comma operator, like so:
print(this, delimiter, that, delimiter, otherthing)

### 8: Formatted output of strings and numbers
Write a program that asks the user to enter a common word, a number from 1 to 200, and a floating point number from 1 to 100, echo each to the screen, and then print out each item as follows:
Each item on a separate line.
All output lined up to 10 spaces max.
Floats printed with two decimal places.

### 9: Type casting between float, int, str
Write a program that asks the user to enter a part of a house (a string), an even number from 2 to 100 (an integer), and a floating point number from 1 to 100 (a float), echo each to the screen, and then convert only the ones you know will work.

### 10: Basic arithmetic with +, -,*, /
Write a program that asks the user to enter an even number from 2 to 100 and a number from 1 to 200, echo each to the screen, and then apply each operator on the numbers, both directions around.
Please note that "+", "-", "*" and "/" are just characters if you print them as strings, so you can embed these characters in a print statement to make the outputs match.
